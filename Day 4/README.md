#### 2. **Tuning a Gemini Model for a Custom Task**
   - Description: Walk through fine-tuning a Gemini model using data from Google Sheets. Includes examples for both API-based and AI Studio-based approaches.
   - Tools Required:  
     - Gemini Model API  
     - AI Studio  
     - Google Sheets integration
   - Steps:
     1. Set up your environment with the Gemini Model API.
     2. Prepare a dataset in Google Sheets for fine-tuning.
     3. Use AI Studio to tune and monitor the Gemini model.
     4. Validate the custom-tuned model for your specific use case.
