# My Large Language Models (LLM) Challenge Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for the **Large Language Models (LLM) Challenge**! This space is dedicated to my journey through the daily assignments, code labs, and research materials, all centered around mastering LLM concepts and techniques. 

## What's Inside
- **Daily Assignments**: Notes and insights from each day’s podcast episodes, whitepapers, and hands-on code labs.
- **Code Labs on Kaggle**: My code and solutions for each lab, with explanations and reflections on LLM techniques.
- **LLM Applications**: Practical projects and examples that explore real-world uses of LLMs, from text summarization to creative generation.
- **Learning Highlights**: Key takeaways on LLM architectures, fine-tuning, training optimization, and inference acceleration.

## Community & Livestream Highlights
I’m actively participating in discussions on the Discord channel and attending daily livestreams with Paige Bailey and guest experts from Google. After completing all code labs by **Nov 22**, I’ll earn the **Kaggle Badge** as a milestone in this challenge.

Follow along to see my progress and learnings in this exciting journey with large language models!
