### **Q&A Highlights**  
The panel addressed critical questions about MLOps in generative AI:  
1. **How MLOps has evolved:** Traditional workflows focused on predictive models, whereas GenAI emphasizes holistic application monitoring, artifact management, and agility due to rapid advancements in models and frameworks.  
2. **Importance of evaluation:** Text evaluation includes BLEU/ROUGE scores and "LLM-as-a-judge" approaches. Multimodal evaluation involves evaluating image-text outputs with adaptable metrics, leveraging Gemini models to improve control and flexibility.  
3. **Challenges simplified by APIs:** REST API models simplify workflows, shifting focus to prompt engineering and evaluation while minimizing traditional data preparation and deployment concerns.  
4. **Key MLOps practices:** Model discovery, prompt engineering, chaining/augmentation, tuning, evaluation, and governance were highlighted as priorities. Vertex AI tools like pipelines, model registry, and agent builders streamline these practices.  
5. **Vertex AIâ€™s unique features:** Vertex AI offers tools for prompt optimization, evaluation, and monitoring. Integrated pipelines and prompt management enhance scalability, while new monitoring capabilities ensure production robustness.
